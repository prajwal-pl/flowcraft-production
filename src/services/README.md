- We've now implemented all the core service files:
- - text-service.ts for generating text
- - image-service.ts for generating and reading images
- - audio-service.ts for generating audio and transcribing audio
- - pdf-service.ts for summarizing PDFs
- - workflow-service.ts for coordinating the execution workflow
-
- All node components have also been updated to display their outputs:
- - generate-text.tsx shows generated text
- - generate-image.tsx shows the generated image
- - generate-audio.tsx displays an audio player
- - read-image.tsx shows extracted text
- - summarize-PDF.tsx shows the summary
- - transcribe-audio.tsx shows the transcription
-
- The editor component (index.tsx) has been updated to handle workflow execution:
- - It calls passDataBetweenNodes to propagate data between connected nodes
- - It calls executeWorkflow to process all nodes sequentially
- - It shows toast notifications for each execution step
-
- When a user clicks "Run Workflow":
- 1.  The workflow service builds a graph of the nodes and their connections
- 2.  It executes nodes in topological order (from inputs to outputs)
- 3.  Each node's results are stored in its outputs property
- 4.  The UI updates to show the outputs for each node
- 5.  Toast notifications are shown at each step of the process
